    ‘The World Wide Web (WWW)’</a>
     , commonly known as the Web,
     is an information system where documents and other web resources
     are identified by Uniform Resource Locators
     (URLs, such as https://example.com/),
     which may be interlinked by hypertext,
     and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2] The resources of the Web
     are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP),
     may be accessed by users by a software application called
     a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server.
     The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet,
     which pre-existed the Web in some form by over two decades and upon
     which technologies the Web is built.
